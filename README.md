# fire-and-smoke-detection

Wildfires are a major environmental issue, causing substantial losses to ecosystems, human livelihoods, and potentially leading to loss of life. Early detection of wildfires can prevent these losses. Our application, WildfireWatch, uses state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model for real-time wildfire and smoke detection in images and videos.
